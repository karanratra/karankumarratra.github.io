  author     = {Ratra, Karan Kumar and Seth, Dhruv Kumar and Uppuluri, Sriram},
  abstract   = {The more significant the e-commerce websites are and the greater the number of users and transactions each day, the greater the energy demand, both economically and environmentally. The architecture for energy efficiency without compromising performance or scalability is proposed in this paper as an AI-powered hybrid edge-cloud microservices system. The infrastructure intelligently distributes workloads across edge and cloud nodes using AI to identify traffic trends, dynamically assign resources, and run energy efficiently. The design principles are energy-aware microservices, resource scalability, and real-time energy monitoring. The solution saves on overhead using lightweight containerization and allows for elasticity to change. Testing on the ground has proven the architecture to save energy consumption at high-demand times such as Black Friday or latency-sensitive tasks such as personalized retail offers.},

  author     = {Aneeshkumar P. and Seth, Dhruv Kumar  and Ratra, Karan Kumar and Swamy, Kireeti Athamakuri},
  abstract   = {The growth of online shopping has emphasized the importance of convenient payment systems that safeguard both customers and businesses from activities. While traditional verification techniques serve a purpose, they must often balance security and user satisfaction. This article presents a remedy: Time Limited Deferred Authorization integrated into the 3DS 2. 0 Verification process within the “Submit Order” stage of transactions. This approach boosts security through validation guaranteeing that only approved cardholders can finalize purchases. This method enhances security by providing an additional layer of real-time authentication, ensuring that only authorized cardholders can complete transactions. Compared to existing solutions like CVV, AVS, and tokenization, this approach uniquely combines multifactor authentication with a user-friendly process, reducing friction at checkout. By addressing vulnerabilities associated with traditional methods, this implementation minimizes the risk of chargebacks due to fraud and increases compliance with global payment security regulations. The deferred authorization mechanism adds flexibility to the 3DS process, preserving a seamless user experience while boosting consumer trust. The technical novelty of this solution lies in its ability to dynamically balance robust security measures with optimized transaction flow, making it a crucial advancement in secure, user-friendly e-commerce payment systems.},

  author     = {Ratra, Karan Kumar and Sharma, Gaurav and Seth, Dhruv Kumar},
  abstract   = {This paper explores the paradigm shift in the current software development era by test automation facilitated by artificial intelligence (AI). Integrating testing activities as early in the software development lifecycle as possible is the focus of the shift-left testing culture. This article explores AI-powered developments like automated test creation tools, intelligent prioritization of test cases, real-time anomaly detection and enhanced test reporting with AI integration. The advantages of AI in boosting coverage, cutting defect-related expenses, and increasing testing efficiency are also covered as case studies in this paper, with real-world examples from SaaS and automotive companies. Although there is no denying the advantages of automated AI systems, there are concerns about maintaining data accuracy, preventing biases, and controlling implementation costs. The paper concludes by pointing out the possible ways to use AI-enabled early-stage testing solutions, what, if any, benefits they could offer towards the development of software testing procedures, and why it is essential to include ethical and responsible AI in software testing strategies.},

  author     = {Seth, Dhruv Kumar and Ratra, Karan Kumar},
  abstract   = {Load-balanced elastic distributed systems such as the ones offered by microservice architectures require efficient deployment of new features as well as updates to be stable and performant. This paper aims to identify basic concepts that will help realize these goals, such as Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and deployment models like the blue/green and canary ones. Feature flags and the zero downtime technique are also discussed with emphasis on their function with regard to the avoidance of service interruptions during updates. Much emphasis is placed on the subject of monitoring and observability of deployments, including feedback and workarounds in real-time. Concerns about security measures and the strategies for improving the performance of the system to support security measures to deploy are presented. Moving forward, newer trends like AI automation, improved observability, and the integration of edge computing are expected to take the deployment process to new heights. The steady improvement of the actual deployment practices themselves is acknowledged as one of the crucial factors in sustaining a competitive edge and securing the durable success of distributed systems in contemporary clouds.},
