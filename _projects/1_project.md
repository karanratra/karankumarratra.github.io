<h4> <b> ‚úçÔ∏è IEEE Authored Research </b> </h4>

I have published and reviewed IEEE conference papers in areas including:

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>AI-Driven Hybrid Edge-Cloud Architecture for Big Data Analytics</strong><br>
    Exploring scalable frameworks for integrating AI models across edge and cloud to process and analyze massive data streams in real time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Secure API Gateways for Microservices</strong><br>
    Designing resilient and intelligent API gateways that enforce zero-trust security, anomaly detection, and traffic optimization in distributed systems.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Real-Time Event-Driven Fulfillment in Global E-Commerce Systems</strong><br>
    Architecting high-throughput event pipelines for orchestrating inventory, shipping, and customer workflows with global scalability.
  </li>
</ul>

These papers contribute to the academic discourse on scalable infrastructure, data security, and intelligent systems design.

<h4> <b> üìù IEEE Journal & Conference Paper Reviewer </b> </h4>

<!-- The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above: -->

<!-- {% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %} -->
